## Purpose

This project is a part of my education for Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp. Our objective was to integrate Javascript functions within a semi-completed page. We designed functions to prompt users to input employee data until they were finished, track the data in an array, log the average salary of all employees to the console, and log a random employee from the roster to the console.

## Technologies Used

This project was completed using [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/about), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and [Git Hub](https://github.com/).

### HTML and CSS Elements

The HTML and CSS elements in the page were provided with the start code and were not altered.

### Javascript

I designed three main functions to complete four (or maybe three and a half) main objectives:

* Prompt users to enter employees' first and last names and salaries. A collage showing each prompt is displayed below. After the user is done entering an employee's salary, a prompt appears that asks the user to confirm if they'd like to continue entering data or not.

* Return the employee data to an array
* Log the average salary to the console after the user is done entering data. A screenshot of the average salary log in the console can be found [here](/assets/PayrollCompletedTable02.png) or [in the completed site build section](#screenshot-of-completed-site-build)
* Choose a random employee and log the return to the console after the user is done entering data. A screenshot of the random employee log in the console can be found [here](/assets/PayrollCompletedTable02.png) or [in the completed site build section](#screenshot-of-completed-site-build)

There are descriptive comments in the [Javascript file](/script.js) that detail each line of code that I added.

Some of the Javascript present in the application was provided in the starter code and was not modified. There is a divide within the Javascript file that states as much.
